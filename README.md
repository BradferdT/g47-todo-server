# Todo list server

The purpose of this is to create a server that will create, read, update and, delete todos.

## Getting Started
Things to do:
`
npm init -y
npm install --save express body-parser
`

## Goal

Create a server that allows you to add and retrieve one or all todos using Postman.

## Stretch

Add the ability to update and delete individual todos using Postman.

## Stretch

Add a front end to it that will let you both add and remove todos. Create a folder called "public" in your root
directory and add index.html to it. HINT: Look up how to use "express.static"
in the ExpressJS documentation.

## Stretch

Add the ability to edit the todos on the front end.

## Last stretch

Add some style using Bootstrap or Materialize or a CSS library like that.
